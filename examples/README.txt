Examples for MDAnalysis
=======================

These python scripts show how MDAnalysis has been used to analyze MD
trajectories produced by LAMMPS or Charmm. They are provided as
real-world examples but no effort has been made to make them
userfriendly; in fact, they will probably not work right away for you
as many assumptions have been simply hard coded.

They have also been used with older versions of MDAnalysis and might
be broken. Feedback is appreciated as are your own example scripts.

Please discuss these scripts on the mailing list
http://groups.google.com/group/mdnalysis-discussion or file bugs
through the issue tracker
http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/list



Descriptions
============

Please see the scripts for details., They are all fairly short.

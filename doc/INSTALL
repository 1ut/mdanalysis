== Installing MDAnalysis ==

Currently MDAnalysis is only distributed in source form. You will need
a C compiler and pyrex to compile the DCD reader and numerical
extensions.

In the top directory, you can customize the setup by copying the setup
configuration template to setup.cfg and editing it.

   cp setup.cfg.template setup.cfg

For instance, you can choose to use the Intel compiler for faster
code if you have it installed. However, this is not required and
everything should work without touching setup.cfg or setup.cfg.template.


In principle, installation should be as simple as

   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install

This installs MDAnalysis in the system wide python directory; this may
require administrative privileges.

It is also possible to use --prefix and --home options for setup.py
to install in a different (probably your private) python directory
hierarchy.

If you want to install in a specific local directory use

  python setup.py build --build-lib=LOCAL_DIRECTORY

This installs a working MDAnalysis in LOCAL_DIRECTORY/MDAnalysis.



For testing we currently simply use

   python setup.py build --build-lib=~/python-lib/

This builds and installs a working version in
~/python-lib/MDAnalysis. Then add ~/python-lib to the PYTHONPATH

  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/python-lib


== OS specific notes ==

=== Linux ===
* Tested with GNU compilers or Intel compilers and Intel MKL.

* To compile with the Intel compilers, set in setup.cfg

  [build]
  compiler=intel

  and install the Math Kernel Libraries (MKL). You may have to change
  the 'fast_numeric_*' paths in setup.py if you installed in a
  non-standard location.

=== Mac OS X ===
* Tested with Mac OS X 10.4.11 and fink.

  The RMS-fitting code uses the fast vecLib framework for linear
  algebra.

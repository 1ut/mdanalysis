== Installing MDAnalysis ==

Currently MDAnalysis is only distributed in source form. You will need
a C compiler and pyrex to compile the DCD reader and numerical
extensions.

In principle, installation should be as simple as

   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install

In version 0.5.0 this only works when installing (with root
priviledges) into the site-wide python dir. If you want to install in
a local directory use

  python setup.py build --build-lib=LOCAL_DIRECTORY

This installs a working MDAnalysis under LOCAL_DIRECTORY.



For testing we currently simply use

   python setup.py build --build-lib=~/python-lib/

This builds and installs a working version in
~/python-lib/MDAnalysis. Then add ~/python-lib to the PYTHONPATH

  export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/python-lib


== OS specific notes ==

=== Linux ===
* Tested with GNU compilers or Intel compilers and Intel MKL.

* To compile with the Intel compilers, set in setup.cfg

  [build]
  compiler=intel

  and install the Math Kernel Libraries (MKL). You may have to change
  the 'fast_numeric_*' paths in setup.py if you installed in a
  non-standard location.

=== Mac OS X ===
* Tested with Mac OS X 10.4.11 and fink.

  The RMS-fitting code uses the fast vecLib framework for linear
  algebra.

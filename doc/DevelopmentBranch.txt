Guidelines and tips on working with the UNSTABLE development
branches. See also http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/DevelopmentBranch


Introduction
============

The main development branch (i.e. the tar balls one can download and
the corresponding svn "trunk") is supposed to be reasonably stable and
usable. However, in order to test and introduce new features and
improves old ones (while possibly breaking immediate backwards
compatibility) we also have additional development branches. Everyone
is more than welcome to use those branches but you should be aware
that you are then first and foremost a alpha-tester: Things may break
in horrible ways (but your feedback is much appreciated) 

Getting the UNSTABLE branch
===========================

All unstable branches can be found under Source in Directories > svn > branches.

In order to check out e.g. the development-UNSTABLE-orbeckst branch::

   svn checkout http://mdanalysis.googlecode.com/svn/branches/development-UNSTABLE-orbeckst MDAnalysis_UNSTABLE

Building & Installing
=====================

Production installation
-----------------------

The latest versions are using setuptools and EasyInstall (Note
EasyInstall currently broken OB 2010-03-10)::

   cd MDAnalysis_UNSTABLE
   python setup.py install --install-dir PATH_TO_PYTHONLIBDIR

or try

   easy_install.py --install-dir PATH_TO_PYTHONLIBDIR ./MDAnalysis_UNSTABLE

Development
-----------

At the moment, simply use the following build procedure ::

   cd MDAnalysis_UNSTABLE
   python setup.py develop --install-dir PATH_TO_PYTHONLIBDIR

where PATH_TO_PYTHONLIBDIR is the path to a directory that's in your
PYTHONPATH (see also Install). This uses setuptools' development
installation: The library in site-packages (or PATH_TO_PYTHONLIBDIR)
is linked to the source code.

Note that this procedure will overwrite an existing installation of
MDAnalysis! You may want to rename the original installation.

Issues
======

    * The KDTree module does not compile with the Intel Compiler v9.0
      and python 2.3. Using gcc seems to work, though. (r125)

    * EasyInstall installation is broken.

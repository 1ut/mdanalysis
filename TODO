== Feature requests and pertinent bugs ==
(see also http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/list )

* full Gromacs support (read topology from tpr file and trajectory
  from xtc/trr) #1, #2

* generate a primitive topology (psf) from a pdb file so that one
  can read in pdbs directly

* hydrogen bond analysis

* read xyz files (maybe we can use the VMD molfile plugin for all the file reading??)

== Installation ==

* make it work with easy_install; current problems
  - at least on Ubuntu/Linux the *.so files are not found when installed
    as a egg and import fails with _dcd***.so not found

* make the fast math libs more user friendly

* intel compiler does not work (at least Ubuntu 8.04 Linux)

=========================
Test cases for MDAnalysis
=========================

We are using the NumPy_ testing frame work; thus, numpy *must* be
installed for the tests to run at all.

Run the tests with
   >>> import MDAnalysis.tests
   >>> MDAnalysis.tests.test()

Note that if no tests are being run then one has to remove the executable bit
from all *.py files in the test directory::
  chmod a-X ..../MDAnalysis/tests/*.py
as described in `nose, subversion and executable bits`_.

The simulation data used in some tests are from [Beckstein2009]_ (adk.psf,
adk_dims.dcd) or unpublished simulations (O. Beckstein).

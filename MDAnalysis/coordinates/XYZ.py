    """Reads from an XYZ file
    Data:
        ts                     		 - Timestep object containing coordinates of current frame

    Methods:
        len(xyz)                           - return number of frames in xyz
        for ts in xyz:                     - iterate through trajectory
    
    Note: this can read both compressed (foo.xyz) and compressed (foo.xyz.bz2 or foo.xyz.gz) files; 
          uncompression is handled on the fly 

    Validation: the geometric centre of 1284 atoms was calculated over 500 frames using both MDAnalysis and 
    a VMD Tcl script. There was exact agreement (measured to 3DP). bzipped and gzipped versions of the XYZ file
    were also tested
          
    Resources: the XYZ format was taken from
        http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/molfile/xyzplugin.html
    and is therefore compatible with VMD (you need a PDB or PSF file to define the topology, just as here)
    
    # comments are not allowed in the XYZ file
    # the atom name (first column) is ignored
    # the coordinates are assumed to be space-delimited rather than fixed width (this may cause issues - see below)
    # all fields to the right of the z-coordinate are ignored
    # it is assumed that the number following "frame" is the time in picoseconds
    # it is assumed that the coordinates are in Angstroms
    # the unitcell information is all zeros since this is not recorded in the XYZ format
    
    There appears to be no rigid format definition so it is likely users will need to tweak this Class

"""The formats submodule contains code to read coordinates, either
single frames (e.g. the PDB module) or trajectories (such as the DCD
reader). All readers are supposed to expose a Reader object that
represents a common API to the other code.

The Universe contains the API entry point attribute

  Universe.trajectory

that points to the actual Reader object; all Readers are supposed to
be accessible through this entry point in the same manner ('If it
quacks and walks like a duck it probably is a duck as far as I am
concerned.')
